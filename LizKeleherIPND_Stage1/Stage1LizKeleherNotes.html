        Now that I know that what displays on a computer is really the bi-product of a computer reading the directions from someone coding in the computer's "language," what I thought was really hard and complex seems less daunting.

    <h2>It's all a BOX</h2>
        <div class="supporting-info">
          <p>
          It's helpful to realize everything on the web is a box. Now, when I'm thinking about how I'm going to write my code, I can visualize what boxes go where and how to divide things.
          </p>

          <img display="alignleft" src="http://i.imgur.com/gkX91Y8.png" alt="L2boxes" width=300 height=200 />

      <h2><span style="color:purple">WOW</span></h2>
      <div class="supporting-info">
        <p>
          HTML and CSS work together for structure and style. You can use tags that add <span style="color:orange">specific colors</span>
          <a style="font-size: 130%;">or resize the font.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything on the web page is a box. Your HTML determines the structure of the boxes and you can change the style of the boxes with CSS.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="supporting-info">
        <p>
        First, you create a shell of the page you are trying to create by thinking in terms of how many boxes and where they will go. Then, you create reminders for yourself about what you will put in each with "classes" like title, image, etc...

          I'm still challenged to visualize where the different elements of CSS come in to work together. I understand they are both needed to create structure and style, but I want to learn more about how they are partners to support one another and how I'll keep the two that way in my mind as I write my code. In codepen I see that each line of HTML has a corresponding line of CSS- is this how I add that in? I put the CSS in the same line?

            UPDATE! I figured out to make my text centered!

      <h2>Including your CSS</h2>
      <div class="supporting-info">
      <p>
      In CSS you choose the selector you want to apply the style to.

            <p>
              Best practices from the article say to keep your style seperate from your HTML file. AHA moment! CSS does not need to line up with the right place in your code. You use selectors to tell the computer which parts of your code should be in which styles.
            </p>
            <p>
              You use a tag like this &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css¬ù&gt; to connect your CSS to your HTML

      <p>
        Always think about minimizing the amount of code you have to write. You can do this by organizing it and applying the CSS rules in order to bucket things together. This will also help if you work on it again or if you let other people work with your code.
